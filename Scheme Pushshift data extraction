## Main steps to extract reddit data via Pushshift ##
Logic of the code:
1. download all reddit data 
2. verify that the desired data is the same as the one extracted using filters (parameters)
3. If the data looks the same, proceed to identify the elements with missing values (pics, gifs, videos)
4. Use PRAW to collect the missing values and merge them with the original database (using the SubId)
